Rust Creative Projects
=====================

This repository contains practice projects that can be used in real life problems from [book](https://www.amazon.in/Creative-Projects-Rust-Programmers-WebAssembly/dp/1789346223).

# Index

1. [File Parsers](./file_parsers) - This section contains codes to read and parse non-proprietary formats like csv, json, toml etc. Proprietary formats are not yet nicely supported by Rust. They carries risk for lockout.
2. [Databases](./databases) - This section contains codes to read and write anything to databases like Sqlite, Postgresql and Redis. Each database work in a different way and different crates are required to manage different databases.

> This index will be updated as more projects are uploaded
