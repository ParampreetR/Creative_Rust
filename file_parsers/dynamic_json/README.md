Dynamic json Reader
===================
This code demonstrates how we can read json files without knowing what values exit in json files.

In this example, we are reading data from source file and writing it to destination file with some changes. 

# Data

Data is available in [Data](../Data) folder. Which is used in examples.

# Run

```shell
cargo run <path to config file> <path to destination>
```
